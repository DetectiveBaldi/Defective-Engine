# Defective Engine
A small passion project made to expand my Haxe knowledge.

Defective Engine is still in very early development, almost nothing concrete has been accomplished yet. However, I hope to keep working on it, and slowly build up features as time goes on.

## Compiling
Currently, Defective Engine is able to compile to HL, HTML5, Neko, and Windows.

### Required libraries:
- flixel
- flixel-addons
- openfl
- lime
- haxeui-core
- haxeui-flixel
- flixel-input-text
- hxdiscord_rpc
- hxvlc
- SScript

Defective Engine uses the **latest versions** of each library. Using outdated versions may cause unexpected behaviour.

Haxe 4.3.3 is also required.
